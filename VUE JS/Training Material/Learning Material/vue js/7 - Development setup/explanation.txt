1. We use VUE CLI, to write our code.

2. Why we need? - To have a proper web devlopment server, which vue cli provides.

3. How to get VUE CLI? 
 to install : npm i -d @vue/cli
 cmd : cd to your project folder
 cmd : vue create vue-app-name
 some questions will be prompted - (If asked) 
 i : select the stable released version
 ii : choose the 3.x version (the latest one)
 iii : es lint with error prevention only
 iv : lint on save
 v : dedicated config files
 vi : no for defalult future projects 
 enter.
 cd vue-app-name
 npm run serve
 got it in your browser? Its done:)


4. Setup project explantion:
package.json - all scripts and dependencies.
since, we have vue as dependency, we dont need to add that script tag; the vue cdn, to get vue features as all of it is already imported as a dependency in package.json

node modules - all the dependencies modules and packages downloaded, are stored in node modules

src - contains all we'll write our code in.
 main.js - configured as the entry point of our project.
  wherein we mount the app id from the index.html and get necessary imports

 App.vue - The app that'll be mounted on app id.


The vue build workflow - 
    Our code -> which is full of next-gen code and Vue syntax -> on run -> convert code into standard JS code, which browser understands.
