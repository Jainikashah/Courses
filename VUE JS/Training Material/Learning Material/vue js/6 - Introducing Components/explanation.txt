Topic- Introducing components

1. Why we need components? 
Suppose, we have 10 cards of friends. Each having friend name and a details btn. On click of that btn, the details of that friend should be shown.
Without components, We can use for loop to get 10 cards and if statement inside html to get the functionality of the btn.
The error here would be, that onclick of a btn on oe friend's card, will show the details of each and every card.
Thats not what we want. One solution could be to create a property for each friend card and passing its id's and something like that could work.
But suppose having 100 friends, we cannot create a different prop for each of them.  

Here, we need components that will help. components can be used to amke code reusable with each thing concerned about itself only.
Also, larger code would be easy to organize with components.



2. Creating components-
Naming convention - A two word name with a - delimiter. e.g: friends-list.
components can be accessed like html tags.

creating - 
(js):
    app.component('friend-contact',{
        template : `<p>Hello world</p>`,

        data(){}
        },

        methods : {}
    })
(html):
    <friend-contact></friend-contact>

here, app is the main vue app. basically creating components are like creating mini vue apps only, which in turn is associated with the main vue app.
