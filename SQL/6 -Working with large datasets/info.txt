We'll use ecommerce_dataset.txt file here in resources.
And go through all the topics we have learnt so far and practice them out using that dataset.

Q1. Write a query to print no of paid and unpaid orders.
    SELECT paid, count(*) FROM orders group BY paid 

Q2. Write a query to print first_name and last_name of users and whether they have paid or not.
    select first_name, last_name, paid 
    FROM orders
    JOIN users on users.id = orders.user_id
