Sorting is pretty easy in sql, lets see an example:-

    SELECT * FROM products order BY price
    SELECT * FROM products order BY price DESC
    SELECT * FROM products order BY price ASC

default is ascending. if we want descending, add desc. asc is optional here.

=> Two variations of sorting:-
- Non-numeric numbers:-
    SELECT * FROM products order BY name ASC
    SELECT * FROM products order BY name desc

- Multiple columns:-
    SELECT * FROM products order BY price, weight
    SELECT * FROM products order BY price, weight desc
this will first sort by price, and if prices are equal for multiple rows, then for those rows it will sort acc to weight.
can also do desc.
eg -
unsorted:-
price   weight
2       7
10      17
2       9
2       1
1       12
9       6

sorted:
1       12
2       1
2       7
2       9
9       6
10      17

you see, 2 was multiple times, so we sorted that according to weight. its opposite would be desc.


=> OFFSET and LIMIT:-
    select * FROM users OFFSET 40
offset means skip the records. here, its 40, so it says skip first 40 records and show the last 10 ones (if the total is 50)

    select * FROM users LIMIT 10
limit gives the first (10) records from the result.

we can use offset and limit together, like get me records between 20-30
here, offset 20 limit 10 would work.

Q1. Get us 5 most expensive products:-
    select * FROM products order BY price desc limit 5

Q2. Get us 5 least expensive products:-
    select * FROM products order BY price limit 5

Q3. Get us 5 least expensive products except the first one:-
    select * FROM products order BY price desc limit 5 offset 1

Q4. Get us the names of phones of only second and third most expesive products:-
    select name FROM phones 
    order BY price DESC
    LIMIT 2
    OFFSET 1 


Order of writing:- (works anyways, it just a convention)
first order by -> then limit -> then offset.
