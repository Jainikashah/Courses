Let's import a backup file in our pgadmin.

steps:-
- Get a .sql file like we have in our resources. It consists of a lot of data that we can import in our pgadmin. This looks unreadable because its a binary one, but very well readable by our pgadmin.
- Go to pgadmin
- right click on the database -> select restore -> select filename -> select all files from ddl at right botton -> select your file (ig.sql) -> check (only data, owner, single selection, trigger) from side tabs -> keep whats on, on. Click on restore.

Note, if any error occurs, you can view in view details under processes. errors pretty self explanatory.

Some exercise:- (Data from ig.sql file)
Q. Select the 3 users with the highest ids from the users table.
    select * from users order by id desc limit 3 

Q. Join users and posts table show the username of user id 200 and the captions of all posts they have created.
    select username, caption from users
    join posts on posts.user_id = users.id
    where users.id = 200

Q. Show each username and the no. of likes they have created.
    select username, ( select count(*) as no_of_likes from likes where user_id = users.id )
    from users
    OR
    select username, count(*) from users join likes on likes.user_id = users.id group by username
