Utility functions:-

Greatest:-
    select GREATEST(10, 20, 2) 
Get the greatest value from the list. ans - 20

Q. Compute the cost of shipping for each item. the formula is :- take the maximum of (weight * 2) or $30. Means, the minimum is 30 or Calculate the weight * 2 and fetch the maximum of the two.

    as shipping_cost FROM products

Case:-
Allows us to add condition for each record

Q. Print each product name and price, and a description of the price with high, medium and cheap.
price > 600 - high, price > 300 - medium, else cheap

    select 
	name, price, 
    CASE 
        when price > 600 THEN 'high'
        when price > 300 THEN 'medium'
        else 'cheap'
    END
    FROM products

If we have a condition that doesnt match any of the if-else statement, then null is the result.
Its not that more often that we use case, we do such conditional checks morely on our codebase and not on the database side.
