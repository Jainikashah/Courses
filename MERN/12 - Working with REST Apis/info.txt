REST API:-

- Representational State Transfer. An API that uses http requests to access & use data.
- One api uses anothers api to form custom data; APIs are reusable.


Node API versioning:
- Api versioning means, all your routes will fall under a specific version. 
eg - www.spacex.com/v4/planets
here, this api would have multiple versions like v1, v2, v3, v4. 
and v4 could be the latest versions and in some point in future we might stop supporting the previous versions.
- We dont add version name before /* route as its the root route and its not an api route.
- We can also mount all our api under a specific version without writing /v1 or related code everytime. Guess how? Ofcourse by express routers. Create a separate file for routes -> import express.router in there -> add your specific routes without /v1 or related code. -> export it -> now import it in main index file -> app.use("/v1", importedFileRouterName)
- Rem, we have to update our front-end as well.

test spacex api:-
- api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches

Such apis has real good documentation, like pagination, authentication, postman sample api calls, query params details etc.
