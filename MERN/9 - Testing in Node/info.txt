TESTING:-

- Test runner: out of which all our tests code will go through
- Test fixtures: setup or organization modules or tests which itself is one testing env.
- Assertions: inputting data into our testing code
- Mocking: not affecting the real world datasets via mocking while testing.

Earlier we had diff appraoches for all these above features, now we have one - JEST.

cmd: `npm i jest --save-dev`

//Package.json  
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    }

now we can run, `npm test` and jest executes all the test files we have written in our code.

2 main ways of organizing test:-
1. In the root -> server -> __tests_ folder
2. Inside the specific file -> launches.test.js / launches.spec.js

either test or spec is considered by jest. 

We also have another npm package - supertest.
It gives us more features for assertions, kind of an extension of jest.

For code: Refer the course pls.
