How to run js on your computed?
- Ofcourse on our browser. Chrome uses v8 engine that understands js code. But hey, can we use js outside of our browser? Up untill node was introduced, it would have been a little tricky to run js outside of browser, but now its not. With node, its possible to write js code on servers as well i.e. server side scripting. 
Netscape - 1995 - created js
Netscape - 1996 - created liveWire ( a server side scripting language using js only, but that time, it just didnt work)
Google - 2008 - introduced Chrome wherein v8 engine was built to understand js code and made very fast dynamic sites.
Ryan Dahl - 2009 - created node js 
And now JS can be written in front-end & back-end world too.

Javascript runtime - 
- Node js is not a programming language nor a framework but a javascript runtime. what is that? js runtime is a js environment which allows us to write js code and do more stuff on top of that like access db, read files, etc. 
NODE contains v8Engine (of chrome) & Libuv library. Everytime chrome updates v8 enginge, node updates alongwith, making it more faster.
libuv is used for working with server related operations. 
Ryan dahl basically combined the two and let the two integrate it with each other.
Even a web browser is a js runtime. how? - js language is understandable and upon that, additional features like console.log, alert, etc. are added. These features are not of js, but are browser specific.
